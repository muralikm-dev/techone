# Technologies Used

- **React**: A light weight JavaScript library for creating interactive and responsive user interfaces.
- **React Hooks**: A library for accessing state management for functional components
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types
- **Parcel**: A fast, zero-configuration web application bundler.
- **React-Bootstrap**: A CSS framework for responsive design for React applications.
- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework with a focus on simplicity.
- **React Testing Library**: A library for testing React components in a way that mimics user interaction.

## Reasons

- **React**: Application is designed using React application as per the requirement
- **React Hooks**: As the application was designed with functional components used Hooks for State management
- **TypeScript**: I always prefer TypeScript over JavaScript for the strict static typing.
- **Parcel**: I prefered Parcel rather than Webpack as it doesn't need any configuration (zero configuration) and easy to use and faster bundling speed, suitable for small projects like this.
- **Jest**/**React-testing-library**: Default standard for testing React based applications
